          <h3>captivity<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>At the moment, it appears as though I am careening downhill, and so
            I leap out the open window and go crashing to the ground.&nbsp; I
            hear a terrible sound, and the sound grows backwards, dimmer and
            further away.&nbsp; I don’t believe I am hurt too badly, although I
            can not now move as I believe I once did.&nbsp; But that was, it
            must be, a long time ago. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Another appears that seems much like me.&nbsp; Smaller.&nbsp; We
            stare at one another for a long time, then suddenly I am alone.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I can’t remember everything.&nbsp; At the moment, I am confined to a
            small area where there is food and water, for which I am grateful as
            I can be, but meanwhile suspicious.&nbsp; There is a bit of bedding,
            a place to sit.&nbsp; I discover it is difficult to stand up, or
            move around.&nbsp; So I stay in the bed, by the food.&nbsp; Mostly
            it is dark.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            Can’t remember much.&nbsp; At the moment, I am in some kind of
            shelter with others like myself, except that they are all very
            agile.&nbsp; They seem familiar with each other, though they
            squabble over food, and sometimes take what i am eating from
            me.&nbsp; It is difficult to hide the fact that I cannot move about
            very well.&nbsp; Mostly i sit and observe them as they maneuver
            about the shelter.&nbsp; And now and then, a very large, rather
            frightening creature enters the shelter making utterances that sound
            something like singing.&nbsp; It is so huge that i am terribly
            afraid of it.&nbsp; But it leaves food and water, and reaches for us
            with gigantic appendages.&nbsp; Then it and all the others disappear
            and I am left alone in horror, but I must remain silent and try to
            become invisible.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I don’t recall very much.&nbsp; At the moment, the creature is
            reaching for me with its appendages, and I am helpless to resist,
            although I try, flailing madly with my upper body yet dreadfully
            unstable with the lower, so that I am losing my balance.&nbsp; The
            creature clutches me with its great strange wings and then restrains
            me, forcing bad-tasting liquid at my mouth, then pushing its great
            moonlike head very close and touching me with it.&nbsp; I am unclear
            whether this is threatening.&nbsp; I am returned to the
            ground.&nbsp; The others have returned, and we are all given food
            and drink.<br>
            ... <br>
            <br>
            I don’t really remember anything.&nbsp; At this moment, it seems all
            the color has been drained from the world.&nbsp; I am lonely from
            not being able to move around like the others.&nbsp; It has become
            very cold, and it is dark most of the time, and we fight over the
            sleeping arrangement.&nbsp; The creature arrives frequently,
            bringing foods and changing the water from solid to liquid so we can
            drink.&nbsp; It appears to be benevolent, and i find that I feel
            calmer now in its presence.&nbsp; It carries me about and moves me
            from place to place within the shelter, and it replenishes my food
            when others take it.&nbsp; It has a warm body.&nbsp; It is cradling
            me on its legs now and rubbing my own rather useless ones.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            At the moment, I am standing up.&nbsp; The window reveals a
            featureless world, just things that look like sticks, and endless
            white, endless night.&nbsp; And so cold.&nbsp; I guess this is how
            it is now.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I can’t remember very much.&nbsp; At this moment, the creature is
            carrying me out the door of the shelter.&nbsp; I am quite
            nervous.&nbsp; Although there is a sweet smell, and a warmth coming
            down from above as we emerge, still I am apprehensive.&nbsp; The
            world has changed drastically.&nbsp; The creature sits down, with me
            in its lap, and I am looking about me in astonishment.&nbsp; The
            others have dispersed and are running around creating quite a
            racket.<br>
            <br>
            The creature sets me down in a small patch of green, so soft beneath
            me, and above me is a shining warmth, a brilliant light, like a
            great bulb, everything above is blue and glowing like a liquid, the
            air cool but this gentle heat rains down, warming me and causing all
            the ground to sparkle and vibrate.&nbsp; The others are playing and
            so full of joy.&nbsp; And beside me is a lovely splash of purple
            atop a slender stalk, the most beautiful thing, glittering and
            emanating such gentle vibrations, purple petals open to the sun, I
            must destroy it and have it for myself.</p>

          <h3>tiny<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>I bent down for a closer look – for there in the grass in the dim
            sunlight I had spotted what appeared to be a little cloth marble,
            brightly-colored.&nbsp; But as I leaned closer, and saw it suddenly
            move of its own accord, I realized the cloth was the garments of a
            tiny peasant woman, no larger than a bumble bee – and she was plump,
            with a bit of a waddling gait, dressed in long skirts and a shawl,
            with a kerchief wrapped about her head.&nbsp; And I felt a sudden
            agony, a creeping nausea, a terror I could never have anticipated as
            I watched this magnificently tiny person shuffling through the grass
            of my yard.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>The world turned instantly inside out.&nbsp; Everything i had ever
            understood about the reality I only tenuously trusted I was
            inhabiting immediately collapsed upon itself, and I tried to issue
            forth a sound but I was paralyzed on the spot, gasping and staring
            in horror as this tiny woman the size of a grape tomato thrust out
            her hand just as a door appeared on the ground, made ostensibly of
            dirt but solid as wood, with brass handle and hinges, like a
            micro-cosmic Bilco.&nbsp; I tried to scream but was helpless,
            frozen, as she eased it open, disappearing within and down into the
            earth.&nbsp; </p>

          <h3>travels of the moon<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>When the Moon is New, that is to say, when it is born, which recurs
            every 27.3 days, it rises with the Sun, in the East.&nbsp; She
            addresses the Sun with her far away face, her near face invisible to
            us.&nbsp; (The Moon and Sun are having a private
            conversation.)&nbsp; By midday, Moon is highest in the South; and
            later she and the Sun set together in the West.<br>
            <br>
            The following day, Sun rises and Moon sleeps late, waking about 50
            minutes later, and about 13 degrees to the East (which appears left
            of the Sun).&nbsp; Day after day the same – and a crescent of light
            appears to us Earthly critters.&nbsp; It is the Near Face
            having&nbsp; breakfast.&nbsp; A crescent roll of light, a solar
            croissant.<br>
            <br>
            After seven days, the Moon is half-full (but still hungry), and
            rises 6 hours after Sun, at midday, 90 degrees to the visible
            left.&nbsp; She's moving East around the Earth, though if we could
            see her, she'd be mysteriously hanging about in the North.&nbsp;
            Half the Near Face is Dark, and what’s visible left to us to
            speculate through ground glass lenses and pondering seas.<br>
            <br>
            A fortnight along her light snack journey, our fair Moon - having
            stuffed herself with delicious late night sunshine - is Full, and
            she at last rises only as the sleepy Sun sets, 12 lazy hours after
            he had busily risen.&nbsp; They offer their simultaneous greetings
            and departures over our heads – Earth shares for a few moments in
            trinary illumination.<br>
            <br>
            And for the next two or so weeks, Moon continues on, shining and
            dimming, from waxing to waning, to her point of orbital origin; the
            Near Face, satiated, goes to sleep, while the Far Face engages again
            in its philosophical discussions with the sun, something, surely,
            regarding enlightenment.</p>

          <h3> <a href="http" target="_blank">a crate of spiders</a> </h3>
          I had to review a particular bottle of Scotch but I was just so tired
          and all I wanted to do was sit in the restaurant quietly sampling the
          peculiar appetizers.&nbsp; The older gentleman – he reminded me of Max
          Ernst – sat down and encouraged me.&nbsp; ‘I don’t even think it’s a
          very good scotch,’ I said, adding that I didn’t want to insult
          anyone.&nbsp; Out of obligation, however, I reached for the bottle to
          give it another try – and I noticed the bottle was eerily
          beautiful.&nbsp; Not the label – though itself in its simplicity was
          indeed lovely – but the glass, it shone like glowing crystal, seemed
          to have its own proprietary light emanating from within it.<br>
          <br>
          I filled a shot glass and sipped – it surprised me by revealing itself
          to be the golden essence of butterscotch, evaporating wildly on my
          tongue.&nbsp; Astonished, I went to pick up the bottle again to
          examine it, when the fellow beside me reached beneath the table to
          retrieve a bottle stand.&nbsp; ‘They all come with one,’ he said, and
          it was an old wooden crate, about a quarter-metre wide, covered in
          dust and crawling with tiny, plump fuzzy spiders.<br>
          <br>
          ‘Oh, how adorable!’ I squealed, and then ‘No!’ as I brushed aside his
          hand – he was trying to crush one with his fingernail.<br>
          <br>
          As I watched the little crate, marveling at the spiders, they began to
          grow and multiply, until the back of the box was thick with them,
          dressed in the jewel-like colors of Raphael’s palette, thousands of
          eyes, and arms and legs, and tiny faces.&nbsp; A glistening pastel
          bas-relief embedded in an old rickety diorama.&nbsp; In one sense,
          they appeared soft and inviting – I imagined sleeping in the bed of
          them.&nbsp; Then I remembered the Scotch, the impending
          ceremony.&nbsp; ‘I can write about these spiders,’ I told Max Ernst.<br>
          <br>
          But suddenly, Alice, Squinty, and Dinsdale ran up, leaping up onto my
          lap – two blond chickens and a greenblack one, elated by the spider
          feast, and onto the table they hopped and went crashing through the
          unexpected diorama.&nbsp; Bursting through the other side, which was a
          peaceful scene of lovely pastoral farmland, I saw Squinty snatch up a
          pale emerald arachnid and soon the room I was in erupted in chaos, but
          I knew not why.&nbsp; Distracted for many minutes, I lost track of my
          chickens – there was a shattered prism of fat fluffy spiders
          dispersing all about the restaurant, some perhaps escaping into the
          farmhouse in the distance. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          When I returned to my plate, the diorama had recomposed itself, now
          full of pine shavings, and buried in the corner was a buff-colored
          mass, somewhat camouflaged beneath the wood chips.&nbsp; Dinsdale
          grabbed hold and pulled her out, my stunned little Orpington Squinty,
          face swollen from spider bite.<br>
          <br>
          Later, I thought, ‘I should not go skiing, something tells me I will
          forget to bring the skis...’&nbsp; Which is precisely what
          happened.&nbsp; And I accidentally – or, rather, absentmindedly –
          parked my car on the frozen lake, which all too soon converted to
          slush and consumed it, I could see the top of the windscreen as it
          sank.

          <h3>blood bags<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>There was once a time, in the old days, when she would ride the
            train to meet us, and pick up the blood bags herself.&nbsp; People
            would employ all manner of dilapidated vessel to transport their
            lot:&nbsp; old white kitchen trash bags with puncture wounds;
            repurposed grocery sacks, splitting at the seams; funnels with
            masses of tape on the bottoms; hard hats.&nbsp; I even saw a fellow
            attempting to contain the sloshing liquids in a paper bag, sodden
            and blackened and threatening to tear – but we were all very
            desperate in those days.<br>
            <br>
            She was of a great height, three meters at least, with skin the
            color of mud, close-cropped hair of wiry moss and black almond eyes
            that few were willing to meet with their own.&nbsp; Her surface
            dripped with strange dimensionless beads and strands of token silk,
            fantastic spider plaiting; her garments were of woven shimmering
            strands interlaced with dull and muted stripes that reached in long
            snake ribbons the length of her towering form down to the cold hard
            floor.<br>
            <br>
            She would arrive on a separate track, in what was once a gypsy
            caravan.&nbsp; We would wait crammed in the railway carriage at the
            station for her to board, so many mutually unintelligible
            utterances. She had a mystical way with leaks, and as we filed into
            the car in front where she received us from her private room, deep
            red spouting like fountains from bulging plastic skins, she would
            collect one or two at a time almost magically, invisibly, forming
            small folds, some clever origami to prevent the seeping of
            fluids.&nbsp; Her gifts could stun the Heavens.<br>
            <br>
            No one was allowed in the chamber.&nbsp; One day, an overzealous
            neophyte reached out with grubby, grabby hands, jostling someone
            with a large wax-coated tote, spilling the contents all over the
            floor, right at the foot of the entrance.&nbsp; The blood splashed
            all over the walls of the car.&nbsp; And splattered the blacked-out
            windows, passenger-etched with the spastic impatience of
            history.&nbsp; The aisle was slithering with fatty chunks, bones, a
            few hands and toes, and something resembling tripe which I did not
            recognize to be human.&nbsp; We stood frozen as if photographed,
            clutching our precious satchels in our red-soaked battered shoes and
            dirty feet, waiting with dread.&nbsp; She was silently enraged,
            after so many eons slipped without ceremony back behind the door,
            and thereafter did not come to meet us herself, but sent small
            children with buckets.<br>
            <br>
            In later years, the whole operation seemed to become more
            corporate.&nbsp; But one still had to come to exchange blood for
            train fare.</p>

          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>The captain gathered crew and passengers on the deck as the sun
            beyond was being eviscerated by the horizon.&nbsp; “The situation is
            grim,” he proclaimed, “we shall not all survive the night.”&nbsp;
            Ice that glistened along the grid of the ratlines collected and
            produced a terrible, saintly golden glow, last gasps of the dying
            sun.&nbsp; “Understand now,”&nbsp; he went on, “you must prepare to
            meet your end.”<br>
            <br>
            Women and children were thrown summarily overboard at the outset,
            along with anyone who might dissolve, inconsolable, into
            hysterics.&nbsp; Freezing summits of surging sea went hurtling
            themselves over the balustrade, creeping mightily across the planks
            of the forecastle, raining down all the way into the hold.<br>
            <br>
            When the base of the mizzenmast finally gave way, the nimble-minded
            stoic shouted, “TIMBERRRRR!” and then chuckled, stalactites shining
            from his frozen beard, waiting patiently for death.</p>

          <p>I really hadn’t wanted an autopsy.&nbsp; If I’d had any say... but
            alas.&nbsp; It’s a little late now.&nbsp; So I’m waiting, it’s
            probably cold but I can’t actually tell.&nbsp; Not a feeling of
            cold, just... an understanding.&nbsp; A recognition.&nbsp; I’m
            probably in the morgue at the university, I presume I am donning a
            toe tag.<br>

            I figure I can just treat it like a party.&nbsp; A little gathering
            of med students, pathologists.&nbsp; I wouldn’t mind attending, as
            someone other than the guest of honor... not because I’d rather not
            be dead – I don’t mind being dead, it’s pretty peaceful, actually,
            as I’d hoped.&nbsp; I was never much for the frustration of living
            anyway.<br>
            <br>
            But I’d rather not be autopsied.&nbsp; Truth be told, my dream was
            always to be fed to tigers.&nbsp; There was a time when I thought
            I’d like to meet my end being torn apart by tigers.&nbsp; Seems only
            fair, to suffer that way, after everything my awful species has
            done.&nbsp; And I had a favorite cat once who was shredded by a
            fisher, a giant weasel.&nbsp; And I'd wanted to share my empathy.<br>
            <br>
            But lately I have gotten – had gotten – less sentimental, and was
            just hoping for a fast, quiet end.&nbsp; Which I got, unexpectedly,
            but murder often requires an autopsy...<br>
            <br>
            Here they come.&nbsp; Please, one of you, put a hanky over my head,
            or something.&nbsp; Maybe an old-fashioned bandana with a smiley
            face on it it.&nbsp; You know, Have A Nice Day.</p>

          <p>There was once a land where all they knew were onions.&nbsp; Onion
            stew, onion pie (but without the butter), onion juice, onions
            raw.&nbsp; No one had ever known anything else.<br>
            <br>
            But at one time in this land's history, there was a small girl who
            dreamed of strange foods -&nbsp; of flapjacks, of rice and beans, of
            pumpkin soup, of butter and jam and cream and asparagus souffle, and
            truffles.&nbsp; She had olfactory hallucinations of pastries, and
            lasagna, and marmalade, other unworldly things.<br>
            <br>
            To her, the rest of the world was populated by strangers with bad
            breath.</p>

          <p>I have an anvil, made from polished pearls.&nbsp; It is said that
            it was designed for a butterfly blacksmith, a delicate and intimate
            artist who fashioned armour for pangolins out of lamb spittle and
            meteor dust.&nbsp; The forge was an open channel to an immaterial
            volcanic pool, like a tide pool, filled with molten stone hermit
            crabs who sang lullabies to far off planets.<br>
            <br>
            The typewriter keys bang away in the upstairs garret.&nbsp; The

          <p>I am always feeling ill, though nothing seems to be amiss with my
            health.&nbsp; I have had samples of every organ, from all my 200
            bones, shipped carefully packaged to all kinds of specialized
            laboratories all over the world, and not a one can find even the
            most minutely mutated bit of a single cell.&nbsp; It baffles the
            scientific community, that I am nevertheless this sickly.&nbsp; I
            declare it must be this most alien air, not a pastime on my own
            planet, where plants rule the respiration, where the sun still sits
            quietly golden in a looming yet distant sky, where no harsh thoughts
            are depicted by the atmosphere.&nbsp; Where purity is water and even
            fish come to a faucet to drink, it is that clean.&nbsp; But here I
            swear to you my lungs are caked in irradiant dust, my nervous web
            pounced upon by humming electrified fences whipping through the air
            at great speeds, where the dictation one takes is dark and dismal
            and never-ending; no silences here.</p>

          <h3>the hallucinating yak<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>There was once a man who dressed as a woman and crossed the Sahara
            desert in his bare feet.&nbsp; On one occasion, these things
            happened simultaneously.&nbsp; His journey was tumultuous.&nbsp; His
            books were invisible for decades during a period after the event,
            but have since been re-discovered by an hallucinating yak.<br>
            <br>
            This yak was found in an egg on the estate of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;
            A nightjar found it and made the means to carry it home, by scooping
            out a small cavern in a bale of hay.&nbsp; The nightjar was known to
            fight with her neighbor, a jackal, who had three legs and six
            eyes.&nbsp; What caused their differences, no one knew; not the
            half-buried Moai, nor the lonely four Toltec warriors, gazing out
            across the pyramid for signs of an enemy.<br>
            <br>
            One evening the nightjar sat knitting tree branches in the
            dark.&nbsp; Great solid flakes of snow spun furiously in the shadowy
            air, clicking and tapping against the window.&nbsp; The egg with the
            yak inside became curious, and watched closely for the bird to
            sleep, and when she did, knitting needles falling to the late autumn
            ground with a soft puffing sound, the egg rolled quietly beneath the
            leaves, skirting great gnarled roots and escaping into the brash and
            humble forest.<br>
            <br>
            Inside the egg, rolling and turning and slowly spinning, the
            brilliant liquitine colors of round velvet walls dripped silently
            before the young yak’s eyes, fluidly spilling in and out of a
            glittering gel-like air.&nbsp; Surrounding every surface.&nbsp; Soft
            and impermanent.&nbsp; Keeping imaginations warm, the enticing hands
            of a gentle farmer, gathering eggs for the first time, eggs full of
            spiraling prismatic dreams.</p>

          <h3>halloween tree<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>Why does no one ever remember the rooms in the backs of
            houses?&nbsp; In every house I’ve ever been in, there is always a
            collection of rooms – a conglomeration – down a hall at the far end
            of the structure.&nbsp; the house on the hill between the highways;
            the cylindrical stone tower in the center of the city, even that;
            the place in the fallen leaves with its long-forgotten pool and
            solarium.&nbsp; And the unfinished masterpiece built into the cliff
            by that wealthy architect and his gaunt black-haired wife, sipping
            exotic drinks on a chaise longue by a crumbling jungle.<br>
            <br>
            I remembered again this time, even when on one else did, as
            usual.&nbsp; Everyone was piled in the front room, the drawing room,
            with beds lined up as if we were in hospital.&nbsp; I cringed at the
            thought of sleeping alongside them, they all argued so, and they
            seemed to enjoy their entangled, integrated little rage.<br>
            <br>
            I honestly had wanted to sleep, but the bed I was in was bent on
            trying to suffocate me, the room was stifling with static from the
            television sets.&nbsp; ‘You can have your own set,’ someone said,
            and it seemed to me the room itself glanced at me strangely when I
            insisted I didn’t want one.&nbsp; Nor did I want the take part in
            experiencing the sexual suppositories they were passing around, so
            fashionable in those days.<br>
            <br>
            I thought I would be able to move one of the beds once I found the
            back rooms.&nbsp; I thought of telling the sister, who behaved as if
            she lived there, that we ought have everyone leave before midnight
            so we could redress the house.&nbsp; But something told me no, she
            was too in love with the hospital bed arrangement, too immersed in
            static.<br>
            <br>
            So I got up and found the lost hallway, sensing there were two rooms
            on either side and one in the back – the width of the house – since
            that is the typical format.&nbsp; None of the bulbs appeared to be
            working properly.&nbsp; I had with me my tiny horse Kelso.&nbsp; I
            tried the switches again and again but at first nothing
            occurred.&nbsp; The back room was dark and a strange oppressive
            object seemed to fill the space – it was a Halloween Tree, with tiny
            jackolanterns and black bats and cats for leaves, clinging tightly
            from the ceiling like the lights of the Indian restaurant on East
            First Street.&nbsp; There was already a bed – I wondered whether it
            were full of dust.&nbsp; The shelves were filled, every surface
            covered, with rows and columns of orange and black, little spiders
            and pumpkins and black dead leaves, rows of black plastic horses and
            cats and rubber monsters, and glowing orange candy corns.<br>
            <br>
            Absentmindedly, I began eating my horse’s legs, thinking they were
            chocolate.&nbsp; As I looked around the room, eating pieces of my
            horse, I noticed an amber glow blink on and off in the hallway – an
            alarm?&nbsp; a greeting?&nbsp; a warning?&nbsp; I bent my head to
            have another bite and saw I was about to put his head between my
            teeth.&nbsp; His body was mangled.&nbsp; I was sure for a moment he
            was made of plastic, too, but couldn’t get a fix on the
            situation.&nbsp; All the lights had come on.&nbsp; There was an
            astonishing abundance of halloween toys tenanting this cluttered
            room which I had hoped to make my own quiet sanctuary.<br>
            <br>
            ‘The hotel manager will come get them any moment,’ I thought, when
            in my hands I felt a warm squirm.&nbsp; It was my horse, who wanted
            to go out and get exercise.&nbsp; I wondered whether the chickens
            were up.</p>

                  which were, in fact, instrumental in the cleanup phases.&nbsp;

                  have been astronomical, and the process not least of all
                  time-consuming.&nbsp; And at this perilous stage of the
                  cancer, time was of the essence.&nbsp; It shouldn't be
                  overlooked, either, that throughout the parasite’s history,
                  there have regularly appeared mutant populations with
                  astonishing creativity and insight, minus the destructive
                  element. So as a scientific and philosophical curiosity, we
                  are hoping to evolve and define any of these positive genetic

                  keeping the herds self-contained within a prescribed range yet
                  sufficiently occupied mentally and physiologically such that
                  they remain within that range.&nbsp; The means to
                  self-sufficiency must be present, but limited, and the urge to
                  expand must be repressed at all cost.&nbsp; Problems had
                  arisen in the pre-sanctuary past, as we all know well, when
                  those defective colonies would spread to the degree that other
                  colonies were encountered.&nbsp; A mutual infection would
                  typically take place leading inevitably to vast ecological
                  blight.&nbsp; In light of such historical patterns, we have
                  learned to allow some nomadic behavior of the preserved
                  species-type, but only in strictly limited regions, and always
                  in isolation. And of course their range excludes all but the

          <p>Zretl was a pale, bluish color, with a short dull head that was
            almost black.&nbsp; He suffered a gestational defect that caused his
            lower arms to be shorter than his upper arms.&nbsp; He had
            engineered the primary teleporting synthechronometron before the
            Impact of the Seventh Moon, and thus many of the modules were now
            still safe underground. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            With his shorter arms, he had been able to polish the scales on his
            own belly to a kind of mirror finish – and the strange red birdlike
            creature he kept in his vicinity was frequently seen tapping madly
            at its own reflection – an activity that, while amusing, gave Zretl
            indigestion, not to mention innumerable pockmarks on his surface

          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>I realize this story might be incredible, but it really is true,
            there were actually at one time aliens on this planet.&nbsp;
            Visitors from another world. When I describe them to you, you will
            no doubt be skeptical, as i said — incredulous. But nevertheless, it
            is all based in fact.&nbsp; I mean, it was so long ago, and we’ve
            retold the story many times, and one has to account for faulty
            memories and various embellishments; we are, no secret there, a
            self-absorbed race.<br>
            <br>
            It absolutely is true that I was there and was instrumental in
            putting an end to the infestation, or ‘visitation,’ or (a laughable
            supposition) <em>invasion effort</em>. Not for the first visits,
            those I had only heard about.&nbsp; But I saw them that last and
            final time.<br>
            <br>
            Let me first explain their strange aspect — these beings were
            actually corporeal, if you can even get your mind around that. Yes,
            like the rocks and ground, solid, with discernible mass…. but
            somehow also like the Fire Lake, I have to say, in that they moved
            about on their own.&nbsp; Isn’t that something?&nbsp; Quite
            clumsily, I might add!&nbsp; No fluidity, no grace.&nbsp; Well,
            their stone dropped to ground like so many other stones from outside
            our Inhabited Layers, but it was an unusual stone in that it came
            apart and then, from inside it, some very little moving stones
            emerged, wobbling about and rearranging so many even&nbsp; smaller
            and smaller stones.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I know it’s generally accepted that corporeal entities are not
            capable of supporting life as we know it, beyond the imitation by
            such pseudo-living phenomena as the Fire Lake and the Liquid
            Reserves.&nbsp; But, well, evidence of this experience indicates
            otherwise, as these motive rock-beings clearly had direction and
            purpose, or shall I suggest the semblance of such things.&nbsp;
            Obviously we have nothing to compare any of this to in recent
            memory.<br>
            <br>
            Those that witnessed the scene reported that the corporeal
            pseudo-life forms scratched about, trying feebly to express
            themselves… but it was an absurd comedy, watching them put bits of
            our rock into their own peculiar rock, then go about just generally
            littering the area with their silly alien debris. Eventually — and
            this was most astonishing and delightful — eventually they congealed
            at last into their primary stone, which soon after emitted a plasma
            heat similar again but in some other way to our own Fire Lake
            (though they could not have known of its existence, so distant from
            their scurrying), and then, utilizing the heat, their stone gained
            altitude and at last departed from our more familiar Layers!<br>
            <br>
            So amusing!&nbsp; We puzzled over this.&nbsp; Were we to imagine
            these wiggly rock monsters possessed of some rudimentary
            intelligence?&nbsp; Yes, it is extremely difficult to envision the
            idea of something with mass as having life, recognizable life, let
            alone any degree of intent, or, even more ludicrous, self-awareness.<br>
            <br>
            …By the third or fourth visitation — for by now we had to admit the
            experience to be deliberate, and not merely anomalous meteoric
            phenomena — the strange smooth glossy space-rock that fell down to
            us had grown quite a bit larger than it had been in the earlier
            times, even larger than some of the small detached stones in our
            Valleys.&nbsp; From inside of it emerged quite a number of the alien
            things, and over time they had actually constructed in the vicinity
            some very elaborate masses resembling caves and boulders, albeit on
            a miniaturized scale, and quite unnatural-looking.&nbsp; How
            comical! Such grand efforts necessary to entertain themselves so
            pitifully, assuming that was what they were up to.&nbsp; So we were
            to imagine.&nbsp; Why else would they be here?<br>
            <br>
            However, they began to perform some rather irritating rituals,
            getting in the way, as it were.&nbsp; For at first we were being
            polite, avoiding them, leaving a wide berth, moving our storms and
            wind carnivals and electrical displays elsewhere.&nbsp; In the past,
            they had always left after a very brief period, but in this instance
            they remained, and began spreading out, and in time came upon the
            sacred Valley and the Fire Lake.&nbsp; This is about when I got wind
            of the gravity of the situation, pardon the puns.<br>
            <br>
            I had been into town to acquire some lighter gases in order to
            ascend to a surveying Layer.&nbsp; You see, I was getting plans
            underway for the Exhibition: we all thought we might like some
            diversion of our own sort, since the rock folk were becoming rather
            tiresome.&nbsp; While in town I learned that one of us had gotten
            all into a cyclone over these beings being in the Valley and
            interfering with the usual spontaneity of the rock slides.&nbsp;
            Really, how much fun is a controlled avalanche of limited
            expanse?&nbsp; I sympathized and offered to heat up at the Fire Lake
            and meet later at one of the Poles — my comrade could arrive there
            beforehand to chill for awhile, then at the appointed moment we
            would collide and release some chaos into the atmosphere, let off
            some steam as the saying goes.&nbsp; Farther out, away from this
            nuisance of the creeping crawling rock creatures from the outer
            limits.<br>
            <br>
            My friend agreed, and during the course of our engaging weather
            outburst in the North, for which we had to travel quite far and put
            off other endeavors, I began to acquire a similar point of view,
            that the silly Invaders had to go, their welcome worn.&nbsp; Why,
            wasn’t it just recently that I had been settled, napping, in a
            favorite outcropping, when a band of these pests came bumbling past
            with their minuscule little stormclouds encased in tiny pebbles,
            utterly oblivious to my presence, and waking me with bothersome
            little shocks.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I can produce lightning like nobody’s business.&nbsp; But
            that’s not the point.&nbsp; It was just the utter rudeness of being
            roused from slumber by a stupid moving stone, sentient or not it was
            still very annoying as I had a bit of a dust-storm hangover that
            morning.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway, to put an end to a rambling tale, and I’m sure you realize
            by now that this truly is based on historical events of which I was
            personally a part, let me just tell you that word spread quickly
            once we returned and confessed our aggravation, and so spread a
            collective disdain for the pests, who no longer earned our
            amusement.&nbsp; So that season we held a massive Exhibition, with
            gloriously choreographed tornadoes, our rarefications seeping
            underground and expanding to burst great broiling bubbles from the
            Fire Lake, catapulting molten stone into the Valley to blast apart
            the vermins' dull little party, and blackened clouds condensed and
            froze to rain down cold pointed shards upon the scene.&nbsp; Liquid
            lifted from the Reserves was summoned to the region to crash down
            around the infestation in one mighty breaking wave.&nbsp; Their
            structures were hoisted and dashed to pieces against the surrounding
            cliffs, suspended in whorls of our powerful gases along with our own
            much prettier stones, and all spun round and round in a hilarious
            blender — and I, I was the one who brought the great icy chunk down
            upon their biggest, glossiest, stupidest rock, the one they arrived
            in.<br>
            <br>
            All around the little monsters dispersed and congealed in such
            marvelous disarray, I swear to you there’s not been such
            entertainment since.</p>

          <h3>another day in anuraphagia<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>A frog sat at the edge of the little stone-encircled pool by the
            entrance to the Castle.&nbsp; This frog was HUGE.&nbsp; Like,
            unnaturally so.&nbsp; Like, size of a guinea pig.&nbsp; Sitting
            motionless.&nbsp; Frogs have these peculiar bulging eyeballs that
            don’t seem to be looking in any direction — what’s probably the
            case, and this could be speculatively verified with minimal research
            hours, is that those freaky goatlike horizontal pupils of theirs
            allow them to see the nigh entire horizon, in almost any direction
            along the panorama of their little stationary froggy vistas.<br>
            <br>
            This big freak bullfrog launched suddenly into the water upon its
            prey — belly flopping amongst the lilypads and duckweed, catching
            the attention of a travelling passerby.&nbsp;&nbsp; My stars, this
            person thought, what a frighteningly enormous frog, and goodness,
            wouldya lookit that, it’s just caught itself a meal… hm, what’s that
            it’s eating.&nbsp; Is that a dragonfly… wait — is that —<br>
            <br>
            Zoom in to the big bobbing giant frog head, and Oh, gross! What — is
            that …. is that FEET?&nbsp; That’s… that’s fucking frog feet, that
            giant frog is eating another smaller frog!&nbsp; Would you
            think?&nbsp; I mean — lookit! holy — !<br>
            <br>
            The other person travelling alongside was thoroughly repulsed and
            wandered off to look at a rickety display of t-shirts and postcards
            at the edge of the flat gravelly road.<br>
            <br>
            But the engrossed traveller marveled at this spectacle, at the big
            bullfrog floating quietly, gulping occasionally which caused the
            little legs to quiver and disappear bit by bit in little fits.&nbsp;
            The smaller frog inside the enormous frog must have been carrying on
            quite a struggling besmothered calamity in there because the
            behemoth frog reached up from beneath the duckweed with both arms
            and grabbed a little foot in each of its hands in order to steady
            the situation.&nbsp; Little toes twitched: the bullfrog kept its
            cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually the sad and angry feet vanished
            mysteriously down the voracious gullet.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, two other average-sized frogs sat huddled together in
            abject terror amongst some rocks at the opposite edge of the pool,
            taking in their dual probably-not-quite-360-degree Tiny Terrors of
            Nature matinee, one frog’s arm, this is totally true, was draped
            over the back of its companion, one might imagine clutching
            fearfully.<br>
            <br>
            Did you know there have been seen in some regions pelicans
            swallowing live ducks?&nbsp; Shocking.&nbsp; The traveller was
            fascinated yet horrified.&nbsp; Endowed with strong feelings of
            empathy and a painfully vivid imagination, disturbing notions
            quickly accumulated as to the little frog’s terrible terrible death
            experience.&nbsp; A horror beyond human horrors.&nbsp; The sudden
            stupefaction of clamping darkness after being ripped so violently
            from an everyday ho-hum meditative moment at home under the peaceful
            setting sun.&nbsp; The traumatic, crashing shift in
            consciousness.&nbsp; Then the subsequent slow suffocation, the slick
            completeness of a peristaltic throaty grip and nothing to look
            forward to but churning acid stomach, or whatever the science of
            frog digestion. <br>
            <br>
            Nightmare images rushed forth in the traveller’s mind of a world in
            which animals and humans lived solely to consume those smaller
            versions of themselves in order to grow indefinitely large. &nbsp;
            The traveller's eyes drifted toward the distracted companion, still
            perusing postcards, and a distressing soliloquy spilled forth: 'I
            can't help imagining some humongous fellow with a huge frightening
            head and a mouth half a meter in diameter plowing down upon you
            unexpectedly and slowly sucking you into his esophagus.&nbsp; Your
            face trapped in a giant ribcage, this monstrous human appetite
            lifting your torso and flailing legs to the heavens for a
            gravity-assist toward some gruesome stench-filled melting hideous
            demise.&nbsp; Really, mere words cannot describe this hellish
            vision.&nbsp; And then — and then who’s to say there wouldn’t be
            another even bigger than —'<br>
            <br>
            The castle doors opened and the queen came delicately out across the
            moat to the roadway to find the two travellers lingering by the
            royal frog pool.<br>
            <br>
            'Isn’t it lovely?&nbsp; The king made it himself.&nbsp; There’s an
            enormous frog in there, even bigger than that fat one you see beside
            the lily.&nbsp; It’s just remarkable!&nbsp; But you know', lamented
            the queen, no longer boasting, 'there used to be dozens of frogs in
            the royal frog pool, so many, he collected them.&nbsp; Not as big as
            those.&nbsp; But somehow they’ve all gone.&nbsp; The king so enjoyed
            them when he was still with us,&nbsp; Before he…. well, I can’t
            imagine what’s become of them, of any of them.'<br>
            <br>
            The weary traveller straightened and sighed heavily.</p>

          <h3>road reversal<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>So a squirrel was driving down the road one evening, it was dark, i
            don’t know how dark i wasn’t there, i only heard about it.&nbsp; It
            had been raining earlier, that i remember, because i remember the
            day, i was polishing my antlers for the festival.&nbsp; Squirrel
            shifted in his seat.&nbsp; It’d been a long drive up from the
            valley.&nbsp; Nice night.&nbsp; Window was open, occasional tail
            fuzz in the face, it happens.&nbsp; At the side of the road way
            ahead, further around the bend, some of those pink forest babies,
            and some juveniles, the adults stooping and foraging for
            sandwiches.&nbsp; The babies round and hairless and ugly, not very
            mobile, the adults would have to pick them up and carry them from
            place to place.&nbsp; Little short squat young ones were waddling
            about, and as is inevitable with those creatures, an inexperienced
            little one wandered out into the road just as squirrel was coming up
            the hill and making the curve.&nbsp; WHAM!&nbsp; Crap! he yelled,
            not having swerved in time.&nbsp; Damn NUISANCE, stupid little
            humans, good lord, why can’t those messy things be eradicated.&nbsp;
            No matter, no harm done.&nbsp; Small they were and didn’t cause any
            damage to speeding vehicles which struck them willy nilly,
            especially in these rural parts.&nbsp; Highways too, though.&nbsp; I
            mean they were just everywhere.&nbsp; Seemed to breed
            indiscriminately any time of year.&nbsp; Squirrel shook his head,
            tsk.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Poor stupid fucker, but they should really
            stay underground where they’re out of our way.<br>
            <br>
            Pink baby smear on the side of the road.&nbsp; Gooey flesh and guts
            exploded out like a popped balloon.&nbsp; The others started at the
            impact, the male looked up and froze momentarily, sandwich dangling
            from its mouth, then it moved back slowly toward the woods, making a
            kind of hooting noise, their alarm sound.&nbsp; The female took a
            step toward the road then suddenly ran off, little ones bumbled
            about awkwardly after their parents.<br>
            <br>
            Soon after the road was quiet again.</p>

          <h3>from memories of a counter girl<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>ancient guy comes in, deafened, oblivious, robotic… going through
            the motions of some long-learned ritual, off to the drycleaners,
            something to do.<br>
            <br>
            he probably lives at the assisted living center nearby.&nbsp; it’s
            just so depressing, his being so old and so barely there, in a
            perpetual daze, but driven to perform this routine as if it’s
            something he’s been obligated to continue, as though it’s an
            essential requirement of his remaining humanity.&nbsp; i imagine
            with terror myself at an impossible age, spaced out, mumbling
            incoherently, at the checkout counter with cans of cat food, though
            all the cats themselves are long gone, addicted to the act of going
            out for cat food at odd hours… and my apartment is stocked with
            hundreds of cans of a variety of brands and flavors because even the
            fading memory of my passed-on companions is finicky.</p>
