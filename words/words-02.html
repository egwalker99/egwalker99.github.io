          <h3>the least fancy thing<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>There was a sort of monk, a translucent solitudinarian garbed in a
            thick brown cloak, a sparse and drab garment, with the customary
            oversized hood that drenched the face inside in shadow.&nbsp; A
            monk, or monk-like – a wanderer.<br>
            <br>
            In the Square, it was always crowded, day and night, and everyone
            dressed like the lunatics they were, covered in shine and glitter
            and wireless implants, scissored hair in multicolored glues,
            bannered in branding and up-and-downloading nonstop.&nbsp; Each
            donned a plethora of screens and readouts and video logos, bristling
            with antennae, utilizing complex, messy codes to say in fact very
            little.&nbsp; Each had ratings for various features, and plug-ins
            and remotes for rating others, constantly evaluating the
            surroundings by means of quite unsophisticated perpetually-shifting
            criteria.<br>
            <br>
            Their bodies were so heavily adorned with noise and bright lights
            and attempts to attract or distract or repel their fellows that the
            movements of trunks and heads and appendages themselves were blunt,
            awkward, graceless.&nbsp; The mass of them bungled beneath
            microphones, megaphones, seeing-eye cameras.&nbsp; Eyes behind
            mirrored glaze reflected merely reflections, and remained narrowly
            and shallowly focussed despite the magnitude of visual lures, their
            ears plugged with the latest transmissions, everything the newest,
            the latest, the most fashionable.&nbsp; An endless contest, upgrades
            every fifteen minutes.&nbsp; So much motion, so much activity; very
            little happening.<br>
            <br>
            Into the Square the monkish figure came, and sat upon a concrete
            pillar by the Kiosk.&nbsp; It was once the place called INFORMATION,
            and during that bygone era it provided just that, in the very old
            sense of the word.&nbsp; It was the place one would visit to inquire
            about things such as where to get a casual bite to eat, or the
            location of the record shop, or how to acquire tickets to the
            subterranean railway system.&nbsp; But now it was likely filled with
            garbage, all sealed up with concrete and plastic, perhaps the
            skeletal remains of the old fella who once sold newspapers from its
            long-gone counter was preserved within.<br>
            <br>
            All the ground was concrete, solidly paved.&nbsp; Every square inch
            for miles.&nbsp; The subway no more, having collapsed long ago and
            subsequently filled in, another receptacle for waste – for outmoded
            devices, for fancy shoes gone out of fashion; nothing was saved – if
            the imagery came back round into vogue, the old styles would just be
            manufactured anew.&nbsp; Disposal and facsimile.<br>
            <br>
            So now, the brown sackcloth figure sat, in the crowded center of the
            square, in the midst of the frenetic shine of factory-fresh
            adornment, of unintelligible quick-speak, so many voices chattering
            but none to one-another – rather to some distant someone over the
            airwaves, momentarily alleviated of a face, such that communication
            might be more palatable.&nbsp; In person, the interactions were rare
            and curt and primarily consisted of inquiring about upgrades, or
            vending them... that kind of thing.&nbsp; And of course the
            body-modification booths, though many of them were by now entirely
            automated.<br>
            <br>
            The brown-clad monk sat jostled by the endless wave of crowds,
            whispering only in the simplest and boldest of languages –
            silence.&nbsp; Sat with a small box atop the robed lap.&nbsp; The
            embodiment of patience.&nbsp; And in time, not too long, from the
            thickness of the throngs there began to emerge the smallest gap
            around the silent figure.&nbsp; Where at first trampling feet were
            so near to crushing toes, where spangled rear ends left their stupid
            farts to linger by the brown hood, and glowing satchels swung
            carelessly occasionally boxed the hidden ears – now there was a bit
            of space, a tiny bubble forming from where the wanderer sat, brown
            box squat on squatting brown knees.<br>
            <br>
            Gradually the stillness emanating from the cloaked form seeped
            further out into the Square; the mute emptiness surrounding the
            vigil by the Kiosk grew until it at last became noticeable enough to
            arouse an atypical curiosity.&nbsp; ‘What’s that?’ asked a shining
            swath of blinking LEDs, skin clad in iridescent tattoos.<br>
            <br>
            The monk opened the brittle, humble box to reveal a small equally
            brown heap, a lump of dirt.&nbsp; No one in the Square had ever seen
            dirt before, most had never heard of it.&nbsp; The questioner
            scowled, as if invaded by a miserable stench.&nbsp; ‘Can’t you
            upgrade it?’<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            The Earth turned magically, the Moon followed suit.&nbsp; A
            fortnight had passed, and the silence had spread concentrically from
            the hooded figure’s core; like a gentle forcefield it pushed the
            crowd further and further out, and the Square was in due course
            abandoned.&nbsp; The horrible noise subdued, the neons and xenons
            and filaments and all their descendants vanquished.&nbsp; Trash
            began to decompose.&nbsp; The celestial bodies rose peacefully in
            the East journeying without fanfare across the southern sky, and
            sank blissfully behind the western edges of the world.<br>
            <br>
            In time, flowers and trees began to grow.&nbsp; The monk passed away
            and was quietly consumed by insects, but this last did not occur
            until the least fancy thing pushed all the glitter and those that
            adored it to a concentrated spot on the opposite end of the globe,
            where their hideous weight caused them to drop off into outer space.</p>

          <h3>captivity<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>At the moment, it appears as though I am careening downhill, and so
            I leap out the open window and go crashing to the ground.&nbsp; I
            hear a terrible rumbling noise, and the sound grows backwards,
            dimmer and further away.&nbsp; I don’t believe I am hurt too badly,
            although I can not now move as I believe I once did.&nbsp; But that
            was, it must be, a long time ago. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Another appears that seems much like me.&nbsp; Smaller.&nbsp; We
            stare at one another for a long time, then suddenly I am alone.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I can’t remember everything.&nbsp; At the moment, I am confined to a
            small area where there is food and water, for which I am grateful as
            I can be, but meanwhile suspicious.&nbsp; There is a bit of bedding,
            a place to sit.&nbsp; I discover it is difficult to stand up, or
            move around.&nbsp; So I stay in the bed, by the food.&nbsp; Mostly
            it is dark.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            Can’t remember much.&nbsp; At the moment, I am in some kind of
            shelter with others like myself, except that they are all very
            agile.&nbsp; They seem familiar with each other, though they
            squabble over food, and sometimes take what I am eating from
            me.&nbsp; It is difficult to hide the fact that I cannot move about
            very well.&nbsp; Mostly i sit and observe them as they maneuver
            about the shelter.&nbsp; And now and then, a very large, rather
            frightening creature enters the shelter making utterances that sound
            something like singing.&nbsp; It is so huge that i am terribly
            afraid of it.&nbsp; It leaves food and water, and reaches for us
            with gigantic appendages.&nbsp; Then it and all the others disappear
            and I am left alone in horror, but I must remain silent and try to
            become invisible.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I don’t recall very much.&nbsp; At the moment, the creature is
            reaching for me with its appendages, and I am helpless to resist,
            although I try, flailing madly with my upper body yet dreadfully
            unstable with the lower, so that I am losing my balance.&nbsp; The
            creature clutches me with its great strange wings and then restrains
            me, forcing bad-tasting liquid at my mouth, then pushing its great
            moonlike head very close and touching me with it.&nbsp; I am unclear
            whether this is threatening.&nbsp; I am placed on the ground.&nbsp;
            The others have returned, and we are all given food and drink.<br>
            ... <br>
            <br>
            I don’t really remember anything.&nbsp; At this moment, it seems all
            the color has been drained from the world.&nbsp; I am lonely from
            not being able to move around like the others.&nbsp; It has become
            very cold, and it is dark most of the time, and we fight over the
            sleeping arrangement.&nbsp; The creature arrives frequently,
            bringing foods and changing the water from solid to liquid so we can
            drink.&nbsp; It appears to be benevolent, and I find that I feel
            calmer now in its presence.&nbsp; It carries me about and moves me
            from place to place within the shelter, though sometimes to areas I
            do not want to be, and it replenishes my food when others take
            it.&nbsp; It has a warm body.&nbsp; It is cradling me on its legs
            now and rubbing my own rather useless ones.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            At the moment, I am standing up.&nbsp; The window reveals a
            featureless world, just things that look like sticks, and endless
            white, endless night.&nbsp; And so cold.&nbsp; I guess this is how
            it is now.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            I can’t remember very much.&nbsp; At this moment, the creature is
            carrying me out the door of the shelter.&nbsp; I am quite
            nervous.&nbsp; Although there is a sweet smell, and a warmth coming
            down from above as we emerge, still I am apprehensive.&nbsp; The
            world has changed drastically.&nbsp; The creature sits down, with me
            in its lap, and I am looking about me in astonishment.&nbsp; The
            others have dispersed and are running around creating quite a
            racket.<br>
            <br>
            The creature sets me down in a small patch of green, so soft beneath
            me, and above me is a shining warmth, a brilliant light, like a
            great bulb, everything above is blue and glowing like a liquid, the
            air cool but this gentle heat rains down, warming me and causing all
            the ground to sparkle and vibrate.&nbsp; The others are playing and
            so full of joy.&nbsp; And beside me is a lovely splash of purple
            atop a slender stalk, the most beautiful thing, glittering and
            emanating such gentle vibrations, purple petals open to the sun, I
            must destroy it and have it for myself.</p>

          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>I bent down for a closer look – for there in the grass in the dim
            sunlight I had spotted what appeared to be a little cloth marble,
            brightly-colored.&nbsp; But as I crouched even nearer, and saw it
            suddenly move of its own accord, I realized the cloth was the
            garments of a tiny peasant woman, no larger than a bumble bee – and
            she was plump, with a bit of a waddling gait, dressed in long skirts
            and a shawl, with a kerchief wrapped about her head.&nbsp; And I
            felt a sudden agony, a creeping nausea, a terror I could never have
            anticipated as I watched this magnificently tiny person shuffling
            through the grass of my yard.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>The world turned instantly inside out.&nbsp; Everything I had ever
            hoped to comprehend about the reality I was inhabiting immediately
            collapsed upon itself, and I tried to issue forth a sound but I was
            paralyzed on the spot, gasping and staring in horror as this tiny
            woman the size of a grape tomato thrust out her hand just as a door
            appeared on the ground, made ostensibly of dirt but solid as wood,
            with brass handle and hinges, like a micro-cosmic Bilco.&nbsp; I
            tried to scream but was helpless, frozen, as she eased it open,
            disappearing within and down into the earth.&nbsp; </p>

          <h3> <a href="http" target="_blank">a crate of spiders</a> </h3>
          <p> The Scotch sat on the table, awaiting whatever came next.&nbsp; I
            was meant to compose an introductory review of it before the
            ceremony, but I was just so tired and all I wanted to do was sit in
            the restaurant quietly sampling the peculiar appetizers.&nbsp; The
            older gentleman – he reminded me of Max Ernst – sat down and
            encouraged me.&nbsp; ‘I don’t even think it’s a particularly good
            Scotch,’ I said, adding that I didn’t want to insult anyone.&nbsp;
            Out of obligation, however, I reached for the decanter to give it
            another try – and I noticed that this bottle was eerily
            beautiful.&nbsp; Not the label – though itself in its simplicity was
            indeed lovely – but the glass, it shone like glowing crystal, seemed
            to have its own proprietary light emanating from within it.<br>
            <br>
            I dispensed a finger into a tumbler and sipped – it surprised me by
            revealing itself to be the golden essence of butterscotch,
            evaporating wildly on my tongue.&nbsp; Astonished, I went to pick up
            the container again to examine it, when the fellow beside me reached
            beneath the table to retrieve a bottle stand.&nbsp; ‘They all come
            with one,’ he said, and it was an old wooden crate, about a
            quarter-meter wide, covered in dust and crawling with tiny, plump
            fuzzy spiders.<br>
            <br>
            ‘Oh, how adorable!’ I squealed, and then ‘No!’ as I brushed aside
            his hand – he was trying to crush one with his fingernail.<br>
            <br>
            As I watched the little crate, marveling at the spiders, they began
            to grow and multiply, until the back of the box was thick with them,
            dressed in the jewel-like colors of Raphael’s palette, thousands of
            eyes, and arms and legs, and tiny faces.&nbsp; A glistening pastel
            bas-relief embedded in an old rickety diorama.&nbsp; In one sense,
            they appeared soft and inviting – I imagined sleeping in the bed of
            them.&nbsp; Then I remembered the Scotch, the impending
            ceremony.&nbsp; ‘I can write about these spiders,’ I told Max Ernst.<br>
            <br>
            But suddenly, Alice, Squinty, and Dinsdale came running towards us,
            leaping up onto my lap – two blond chickens and a greenblack one,
            elated by the spider feast, and onto the table they hopped and went
            crashing through the unexpected diorama.&nbsp; Bursting through the
            other side, which was a peaceful scene of lovely pastoral farmland,
            I saw Squinty snatch up a pale emerald arachnid and soon the room I
            was in erupted in chaos, but I knew not why.&nbsp; Distracted for
            many minutes, I lost track of my chickens – there was a shattered
            prism of fat fluffy spiders dispersing all about the restaurant,
            some perhaps escaping into the farmhouse in the distance. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            When I at last returned to my plate, the diorama had recomposed
            itself, now full of pine shavings, and buried in the corner was a
            buff-colored mass, somewhat camouflaged beneath the wood
            chips.&nbsp; Dinsdale grabbed hold and pulled her out, my stunned
            little Orpington Squinty, face swollen from spider bite.<br>
            <br>
            Later, I thought, ‘I should not go skiing, something tells me I will
            forget to bring the skis...’&nbsp; Which is precisely what
            happened.&nbsp; And I accidentally – or, rather, absentmindedly –
            parked my car on the frozen lake, which all too soon converted to
            slush and consumed it, I could see the top of the windscreen as it
            sank. </p>

          <h3>blood bags<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>There was once a time, in the old days, when she would ride the
            train to meet us, and pick up the blood bags herself.&nbsp; People
            would employ all manner of dilapidated vessel to transport their
            lot:&nbsp; old white kitchen trash bags with puncture wounds;
            repurposed grocery sacks, splitting at the seams; funnels with
            masses of tape on the bottoms; hard hats.&nbsp; I even saw a fellow
            attempting to contain the sloshing liquids in a paper bag, sodden
            and blackened and threatening to tear – but we were all very
            desperate in those days.<br>
            <br>
            She was of a great height, three meters at least, with skin the
            color of mud, close-cropped hair of wiry moss and black almond eyes
            that few were willing to meet with their own.&nbsp; Her surface
            dripped with strange dimensionless beads and strands of token silk,
            fantastic spider plaiting; her garments were of woven shimmering
            strands interlaced with dull and muted stripes that reached in long
            snake ribbons the length of her towering form down to the cold hard
            floor.<br>
            <br>
            She would arrive on a separate track, in what was once a gypsy
            caravan.&nbsp; We would wait crammed in the railway carriage at the
            station for her to board, so many mutually unintelligible
            utterances. She had a mystical way with leaks, and as we filed into
            the car in front where she received us from her private room, deep
            red spouting like fountains from bulging plastic skins, she would
            collect one or two at a time almost magically, invisibly, forming
            small folds, some clever origami to prevent the seeping of
            fluids.&nbsp; Her gifts could stun the Heavens.<br>
            <br>
            No one was allowed in the chamber.&nbsp; One day, an overzealous
            neophyte reached out with grubby, grabby hands, jostling someone
            with a large wax-coated tote, spilling the contents all over the
            floor, right at the foot of the entrance.&nbsp; The blood splashed
            along the walls of the car.&nbsp; And it splattered the blacked-out
            windows, passenger-etched with the spastic impatience of
            history.&nbsp; The aisle was slithering with fatty chunks, bones, a
            few hands and toes, and something resembling tripe which I did not
            recognize to be human.&nbsp; We stood frozen as if photographed,
            clutching our precious satchels in our red-soaked battered shoes and
            dirty feet, waiting with dread.&nbsp; She was silently enraged,
            after so many eons slipped without ceremony back behind the door,
            and thereafter did not come to meet us herself, but sent small
            children with buckets.<br>
            <br>
            In later years, the whole operation seemed to become more
            corporate.&nbsp; But one still had to come to exchange blood for
            train fare.</p>

          <p>The captain gathered crew and passengers on the deck as the sun
            beyond was being eviscerated by the horizon.&nbsp; “The situation is
            grim,” he proclaimed, “we shall not all survive the night.”&nbsp;
            Ice that glistened along the grid of the ratlines collected and
            produced a terrible, saintly golden glow, last gasps of the dying
            sun.&nbsp; “Understand now,”&nbsp; he went on, “you must prepare to
            meet your end.”<br>
            <br>
            Women and children were thrown summarily overboard at the outset,
            along with anyone who might dissolve, inconsolable, into
            hysterics.&nbsp; Freezing summits of surging sea went hurtling
            themselves over the balustrade, creeping mightily across the planks
            of the forecastle, raining down all the way into the hold.<br>
            <br>
            When the base of the mizzenmast finally gave way, the nimble-minded
            stoic shouted, “TIMBERRRRR!” and then chuckled, stalactites shining
            from his frozen beard, waiting patiently for death.</p>

          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>I really hadn’t wanted an autopsy.&nbsp; If I’d had any say... but
            alas.&nbsp; It’s a little late now.&nbsp; So I’m waiting, it’s
            probably cold but I can’t actually tell.&nbsp; Not a feeling of
            cold, just... an understanding.&nbsp; A recognition.&nbsp; I’m
            probably in the morgue at the university, I presume I am donning a
            toe tag.<br>
            <br>
            I figure I can just treat it like a party.&nbsp; A little gathering
            of med students, pathologists.&nbsp; I wouldn’t mind attending, as
            someone other than the guest of honor... not because I’d rather not
            be dead – I don’t mind being dead, it’s pretty peaceful, actually,
            as I’d hoped.&nbsp; I was never much for the frustration of living
            anyway.<br>
            <br>
            But I’d rather not be autopsied.&nbsp; Truth be told, my dream was
            always to be fed to tigers.&nbsp; There was a time when I thought
            I’d like to meet my end being torn apart by tigers.&nbsp; Seems only
            fair, to suffer that way, after everything my awful species has
            done.&nbsp; And I had a favorite cat once who was shredded by a
            fisher, a giant weasel.&nbsp; And I'd wanted to share my empathy.<br>
            <br>
            But lately I have gotten – had gotten – less sentimental, and was
            just hoping for a fast, quiet end.&nbsp; Which I got, unexpectedly,
            but murder often requires an autopsy...<br>
            <br>
            Here they come.&nbsp; Please, one of you, put a hanky over my head,
            or something.&nbsp; Maybe an old-fashioned bandana with a smiley
            face on it it.&nbsp; You know, Have A Nice Day.</p>

          <p>There was once a land where all they knew were onions.&nbsp; Onion
            stew, onion pie (but without the butter), onion juice, onions
            raw.&nbsp; No one had ever known anything else.<br>
            <br>
            But at one time in this land's history, there was a small girl who
            dreamed of strange foods -&nbsp; of flapjacks, of rice and beans, of
            pumpkin soup, of butter and jam and cream and asparagus souffle, and
            truffles.&nbsp; She had olfactory hallucinations of pastries, and
            lasagna, and marmalade, other unworldly things.<br>
            <br>
            To her, the rest of the world was populated by strangers with bad
            breath.</p>

          <p>I have an anvil, made from polished pearls.&nbsp; It is said that
            it was designed for a butterfly blacksmith, a delicate and intimate
            artist who fashioned armour for pangolins out of lamb spittle and
            meteor dust.&nbsp; The forge was an open channel to an immaterial
            volcanic pool, like a tide pool, filled with molten stone hermit
            crabs who sang lullabies to far off planets.<br>
            <br>
            The typewriter keys bang away in the upstairs garret.&nbsp; The
            neighbors say the tenant is a Wolfman.&nbsp; But if the moon were
            never full, how would we know?<br>

          <h3>bad air</h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>I am always feeling ill, though nothing seems to be amiss with my
            health.&nbsp; I have had samples of every organ, from all my 200
            bones, shipped carefully packaged to all kinds of specialized
            laboratories all over the world, and not a one can find even the
            most minutely mutated bit of a single cell.&nbsp; It baffles the
            scientific community, that I am nevertheless this sickly.&nbsp; I
            declare it must be this most alien air, not a pastime on my own
            planet, where plants rule the respiration, where the sun still sits
            quietly golden in a looming yet distant sky, where no harsh thoughts
            are depicted by the atmosphere.&nbsp; Where purity is water and even
            fish come to a faucet to drink, it is that clean.&nbsp; But here I
            swear to you my lungs are caked in irradiant dust, my nervous web
            pounced upon by humming electrified fences whipping through the air
            at great speeds, where the dictation one takes is dark and dismal
            and never-ending; no silences here.</p>

          <h3>the hallucinating yak<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>There was once a man who dressed as a woman and crossed the Sahara
            desert in his bare feet.&nbsp; On one occasion, these things
            happened simultaneously.&nbsp; His journey was tumultuous.&nbsp; His
            books were invisible for decades during a period after the event,
            but have since been re-discovered by an hallucinating yak.<br>
            <br>
            This yak was found in an egg on the estate of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;
            A nightjar found it and made the means to carry it home, by scooping
            out a small cavern in a bale of hay.&nbsp; The nightjar was known to
            fight with her neighbor, a jackal, who had three legs and six
            eyes.&nbsp; What caused their differences, no one knew; not the
            half-buried Moai, nor the lonely four Toltec warriors, gazing out
            across the pyramid for signs of an enemy.<br>
            <br>
            One evening the nightjar sat knitting tree branches in the
            dark.&nbsp; Great solid flakes of snow spun furiously in the shadowy
            air, clicking and tapping against the window.&nbsp; The egg with the
            yak inside became curious, and watched closely for the bird to
            sleep, and when she did, knitting needles falling to the late autumn
            ground with a soft puffing sound, the egg rolled quietly beneath the
            leaves, skirting great gnarled roots and escaping into the brash and
            humble forest.<br>
            <br>
            Inside the egg, rolling and turning and slowly spinning, the
            brilliant liquitine colors of round velvet walls dripped silently
            before the young yak’s eyes, fluidly spilling in and out of a
            glittering gel-like air.&nbsp; Surrounding every surface.&nbsp; Soft
            and impermanent.&nbsp; Keeping imaginations warm, the enticing hands
            of a gentle farmer, gathering eggs for the first time, eggs full of
            spiraling prismatic dreams.</p>

          <h3>halloween tree<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>Why does no one ever remember the rooms in the backs of
            houses?&nbsp; In every house I’ve ever been in, there is always a
            collection of rooms – a conglomeration – down a hall at the far end
            of the structure.&nbsp; The house on the hill between the highways;
            the cylindrical stone tower in the center of the city, even that;
            the place in the fallen leaves with its long-forgotten pool and
            solarium.&nbsp; And the unfinished masterpiece built into the cliff
            by that wealthy architect and his gaunt black-haired wife, sipping
            exotic drinks on a chaise longue by a crumbling jungle.<br>
            <br>
            I remembered again this time, even when no one else did, as
            usual.&nbsp; Everyone was piled in the front room, the drawing room,
            with beds lined up as if we were in hospital.&nbsp; I cringed at the
            thought of sleeping alongside them, they all argued so, and they
            seemed to enjoy their entangled, integrated little rage.<br>
            <br>
            I honestly had wanted to sleep, but the bed I was in was bent on
            trying to suffocate me, the room was stifling with static from the
            television sets.&nbsp; ‘You can have your own set,’ someone said,
            and it seemed to me the room itself glanced at me strangely when I
            insisted I didn’t want one.&nbsp; Nor did I want the take part in
            experiencing the sexual suppositories they were passing around, so
            fashionable in those days.<br>
            <br>
            I thought I would be able to move one of the beds once I found the
            back rooms.&nbsp; I thought of telling the sister, who behaved as if
            she lived there, that we ought have everyone leave before midnight
            so we could redress the house.&nbsp; But something told me no, she
            was too in love with the hospital bed arrangement, too immersed in
            static.<br>
            <br>
            So I got up and found the lost hallway, sensing there were two rooms
            on either side and one in the back – the width of the house – since
            that is the typical format.&nbsp; None of the bulbs appeared to be
            working properly.&nbsp; I had with me my tiny horse Kelso.&nbsp; I
            tried the switches again and again but at first nothing
            occurred.&nbsp; The back room was dark and a strange oppressive
            object seemed to fill the space – it was a Halloween Tree, with tiny
            jackolanterns and black bats and cats for leaves, clinging tightly
            from the ceiling like the lights of the Indian restaurant on East
            First Street.&nbsp; There was already a bed – I wondered whether it
            were full of dust.&nbsp; The shelves were filled, every surface
            covered, with rows and columns of orange and black, little spiders
            and pumpkins and black dead leaves, rows of black plastic horses and
            cats and rubber monsters, and glowing orange candy corns.<br>
            <br>
            Absentmindedly, I began eating my horse’s legs, thinking they were
            chocolate.&nbsp; As I looked around the room, eating pieces of my
            horse, I noticed an amber glow blink on and off in the hallway – an
            alarm?&nbsp; a greeting?&nbsp; a warning?&nbsp; I bent my head to
            have another bite and saw I was about to put his head between my
            teeth.&nbsp; His body was mangled.&nbsp; I was sure for a moment he
            was made of plastic, too, but couldn’t get a fix on the
            situation.&nbsp; All the lights had come on.&nbsp; There was an
            astonishing abundance of halloween toys tenanting this cluttered
            room which I had hoped to make my own quiet sanctuary.<br>
            <br>
            ‘The hotel manager will come get them any moment,’ I thought, when
            in my hands I felt a warm squirm.&nbsp; It was my horse, who wanted
            to go out and get exercise.&nbsp; Gazing out the window, I wondered
            whether the chickens were up.</p>
