                  Yes, the cleanup alone was a monumental task, of not only
                  ridding the planet of the parasitic element, but also of
                  course correcting various biological and chemical imbalances
                  that resulted in the poor health of the orb itself.</font></font></font></p>

                  That’s correct. By the time the project began, many of the
                  antibodies normally employed had been rendered useless, and
                  the planet was riddled with wounds, ulcerations, and
                  infectious material, numerous circulatory and respiratory
                  diseases, as well as a thin cloud of parasitic metabolites
                  surrounding its outermost layers, even beyond its immediate
                  atmosphere. But we’ve been able to eliminate all that
                  successfully and now the orb is surrounded by an appropriate
                  forcefield, designed to prevent any reintroduction by any
                  human parasites that may have escaped.</font></font></font></p>

                    One question on our listeners’ minds, I’m sure, has to do

                    to thrive. Wouldn't the elimination entirely of the

                  Yes, well, that was very much a consideration thoughout the
                  planning phases of the restoration, although we were able to
                  determine the presence of small sub-groups persisting without
                  the self-destructive genetic defect and which were, in fact,
                  instrumental in the cleanup phases.&nbsp; Without them, the
                  resources we would have had to expend would have been
                  astronomical, so to speak, and the process not least of all
                  quite time-consuming.&nbsp; And at this perilous stage of the
                  cancer, time was of the essence.&nbsp; It shouldn't be
                  overlooked, either, that throughout the parasite’s history,
                  there have regularly appeared mutant populations with
                  astonishing creativity and insight, minus the destructive
                  element. So as a scientific and philosophical curiosity, we
                  are hoping to evolve and define any of these positive genetic
                  tendencies that yet may remain.</font></font></font></p>

                  Yes. Well, it is a sometimes treacherous balance, keeping the
                  herds self-contained within a prescribed range yet
                  sufficiently occupied mentally and physiologically such that
                  they remain within that range.&nbsp; The means to
                  self-sufficiency must be present, but limited, and the urge to
                  swarm must be repressed at all cost.&nbsp; Problems had arisen
                  in the pre-sanctuary past, as we all know well, when those
                  defective colonies would spread to the degree that other
                  colonies were encountered.&nbsp; A mutual infection would
                  typically take place leading inevitably to vast ecological
                  blight.&nbsp; In light of such historical patterns, we have
                  learned to allow minimal nomadic behavior of the preserved
                  species-type, but only in strictly limited regions, and always
                  in isolation from other tribes.&nbsp; And of course their
                  range excludes all but the most rudimentary contact with other
                  lifeforms.&nbsp; So each culture's development remains
                  confined to its own... geographic petri dish, if you will, and
                  the desirable patterns are more readily influenced.<br>

                  There is no ‘hierarchy,’ per se. The elder members are keepers
                  of the rules and rituals. It is understood that decisions for
                  the good of the colony are made by them. This primitive

                  True. But in many cases, if not all, the abuses were related
                  to absurd notions of territorial expansion and material
                  wealth. Having eliminated these urges, the very idea of them

          <p>Zretl was a pale, bluish color, with a short dull head that was
            almost black.&nbsp; He suffered a gestational defect that caused his
            lower arms to be shorter than his upper arms.&nbsp; He had
            engineered the primary teleporting synthechronometron before the
            Impact of the Seventh Moon, and thus many of the modules were now
            still safe underground. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            With his shorter arms, he had been able to polish the scales on his
            own belly to a kind of mirror finish – and the strange red birdlike
            creature he kept in his vicinity was frequently seen tapping madly
            at its own reflection – an activity that, while amusing, gave Zretl
            indigestion, not to mention innumerable pockmarks on his surface
            that were frequently lined with grit and saliva, marring an
            otherwise radiant purity.</p>

          <h3>wind power<br>
          </h3>
          <p>I realize this story might be incredible, but it really is true,
            there were actually at one time aliens on this planet.&nbsp;
            Visitors from another world. When I describe them to you, you will
            no doubt be skeptical, as i said — incredulous. But nevertheless, it
            is all based in fact.&nbsp; I mean, it was so long ago, and we’ve
            retold the story many times, and one has to account for faulty
            memories and various embellishments; we are, no secret there, a
            self-absorbed race.<br>
            <br>
            It absolutely is true that I was there and was instrumental in
            putting an end to the infestation, or ‘visitation,’ or (a laughable
            supposition) <em>invasion effort</em>. Not for the first visits,
            those I had only heard about.&nbsp; But I saw them that last and
            final time.<br>
            <br>
            Let me first explain their strange aspect — these beings were
            actually corporeal, if you can even get your mind around that. Yes,
            like the rocks and ground, solid, with discernible mass…. but
            somehow also like the Fire Lake, I have to say, in that they moved
            about on their own.&nbsp; Isn’t that something?&nbsp; Quite
            clumsily, I might add!&nbsp; No fluidity, no grace.&nbsp; Well,
            their stone dropped to ground like so many other stones from outside
            our Inhabited Layers, but it was an unusual stone in that it came
            apart and then, from inside it, some very little moving stones
            emerged, wobbling about and rearranging so many even&nbsp; smaller
            and smaller stones.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I know it’s generally accepted that corporeal entities are not
            capable of supporting life as we know it, beyond the imitation by
            such pseudo-living phenomena as the Fire Lake and the Liquid
            Reserves.&nbsp; But, well, evidence of this experience indicates
            otherwise, as these motive rock-beings clearly had direction and
            purpose, or shall I suggest the semblance of such things.&nbsp;
            Obviously we have nothing to compare any of this to in recent
            memory.<br>
            <br>
            Those that witnessed the scene reported that the corporeal
            pseudo-life forms scratched about, trying feebly to express
            themselves… but it was an absurd comedy, watching them put bits of
            our rock into their own peculiar rock, then go about just generally
            littering the area with their silly alien debris. Eventually — and
            this was most astonishing and delightful — eventually they congealed
            at last into their primary stone, which soon after emitted a plasma
            heat similar again but in some other way to our own Fire Lake
            (though they could not have known of its existence, so distant from
            their scurrying), and then, utilizing the heat, their stone gained
            altitude and at last departed from our more familiar Layers!<br>
            <br>
            So amusing!&nbsp; We puzzled over this.&nbsp; Were we to imagine
            these wiggly rock monsters possessed of some rudimentary
            intelligence?&nbsp; Yes, it is extremely difficult to envision the
            idea of something with mass as having life, recognizable life, let
            alone any degree of intent, or, even more ludicrous, self-awareness.<br>
            <br>
            …By the third or fourth visitation — for by now we had to admit the
            experience to be deliberate, and not merely anomalous meteoric
            phenomena — the strange smooth glossy space-rock that fell down to
            us had grown quite a bit larger than it had been in the earlier
            times, even larger than some of the small detached stones in our
            Valleys.&nbsp; From inside of it emerged quite a number of the alien
            things, and over time they had actually constructed in the vicinity
            some very elaborate masses resembling caves and boulders, albeit on
            a miniaturized scale, and quite unnatural-looking.&nbsp; How
            comical! Such grand efforts necessary to entertain themselves so
            pitifully, assuming that was what they were up to.&nbsp; So we were
            to imagine.&nbsp; Why else would they be here?<br>
            <br>
            However, they began to perform some rather irritating rituals,
            getting in the way, as it were.&nbsp; For at first we were being
            polite, avoiding them, leaving a wide berth, moving our storms and
            wind carnivals and electrical displays elsewhere.&nbsp; In the past,
            they had always left after a very brief period, but in this instance
            they remained, and began spreading out, and in time came upon the
            sacred Valley and the Fire Lake.&nbsp; This is about when I got wind
            of the gravity of the situation, pardon the puns.<br>
            <br>
            I had been into town to acquire some lighter gases in order to
            ascend to a surveying Layer.&nbsp; You see, I was getting plans
            underway for the Exhibition: we all thought we might like some
            diversion of our own sort, since the rock folk were becoming rather
            tiresome.&nbsp; While in town I learned that one of us had gotten
            all into a cyclone over these beings being in the Valley and
            interfering with the usual spontaneity of the rock slides.&nbsp;
            Really, how much fun is a controlled avalanche of limited
            expanse?&nbsp; I sympathized and offered to heat up at the Fire Lake
            and meet later at one of the Poles — my comrade could arrive there
            beforehand to chill for awhile, then at the appointed moment we
            would collide and release some chaos into the atmosphere, let off
            some steam as the saying goes.&nbsp; Farther out, away from this
            nuisance of the creeping crawling rock creatures from the outer
            limits.<br>
            <br>
            My friend agreed, and during the course of our engaging weather
            outburst in the North, for which we had to travel quite far and put
            off other endeavors, I began to acquire a similar point of view,
            that the silly Invaders had to go, their welcome worn.&nbsp; Why,
            wasn’t it just recently that I had been settled, napping, in a
            favorite outcropping, when a band of these pests came bumbling past
            with their minuscule little stormclouds encased in tiny pebbles,
            utterly oblivious to my presence, and waking me with bothersome
            little shocks.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I can produce lightning like nobody’s business.&nbsp; But
            that’s not the point.&nbsp; It was just the utter rudeness of being
            roused from slumber by a stupid moving stone, sentient or not it was
            still very annoying as I had a bit of a dust-storm hangover that
            morning.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway, to put an end to a rambling tale, and I’m sure you realize
            by now that this truly is based on historical events of which I was
            personally a part, let me just tell you that word spread quickly
            once we returned and confessed our aggravation, and so spread a
            collective disdain for the pests, who no longer earned our
            amusement.&nbsp; So that season we held a massive Exhibition, with
            gloriously choreographed tornadoes, our rarefications seeping
            underground and expanding to burst great broiling bubbles from the
            Fire Lake, catapulting molten stone into the Valley to blast apart
            the vermins' dull little party, and blackened clouds condensed and
            froze to rain down cold pointed shards upon the scene.&nbsp; Liquid
            lifted from the Reserves was summoned to the region to crash down
            around the infestation in one mighty breaking wave.&nbsp; Their
            structures were hoisted and dashed to pieces against the surrounding
            cliffs, suspended in whorls of our powerful gases along with our own
            much prettier stones, and all spun round and round in a hilarious
            blender — and I, I was the one who brought the great icy chunk down
            upon their biggest, glossiest, stupidest rock, the one they arrived
            in.<br>
            <br>
            All around the little monsters dispersed and congealed in such
            marvelous disarray, I swear to you there’s not been such
            entertainment since.</p>

          <h3>another day in Anuraphagia<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>A frog sat at the edge of the little stone-encircled pool by the
            entrance to the Castle.&nbsp; This frog was HUGE.&nbsp; Like,
            unnaturally so.&nbsp; Like, size of a guinea pig.&nbsp; Sitting
            motionless.&nbsp; Frogs have these peculiar bulging eyeballs that
            don’t seem to be looking in any direction — what’s probably the
            case, and this speculation could be&nbsp; verified with minimal
            research hours, is that those freaky goatlike horizontal pupils of
            theirs allow them to see the nigh entire horizon, in almost any
            direction along the panorama of their little stationary froggy
            vistas.<br>
            <br>
            This big freak bullfrog launched suddenly into the water upon its
            prey — belly flopping amongst the lilypads and duckweed, catching
            the attention of a travelling passerby.&nbsp;&nbsp; My stars, this
            person thought, what a frighteningly enormous frog, and goodness,
            wouldya lookit that, it’s just caught itself a meal… hm, what’s that
            it’s eating.&nbsp; Is that a dragonfly… wait — is that —<br>
            <br>
            Zoom in to the big bobbing giant frog head, and Oh, gross! What — is
            that …. is that FEET?&nbsp; That’s… that’s confounded <em>frog feet</em>,
            that giant frog is eating another smaller frog!&nbsp; Would you
            think?&nbsp; I mean — lookit! holy — !<br>
            <br>
            The other person travelling alongside was thoroughly repulsed and
            wandered off to look at a rickety display of t-shirts and postcards
            at the edge of the flat gravelly road.<br>
            <br>
            But the engrossed traveller marveled at this spectacle, at the big
            bullfrog floating quietly, gulping on occasion which caused the
            little legs to quiver and disappear bit by bit in little fits.&nbsp;
            The smaller frog inside the enormous frog must have been carrying on
            quite a&nbsp; besmothered struggle in there because the behemoth
            frog reached up from beneath the duckweed with both arms and grabbed
            a little foot in each of its hands in an effort to steady the
            calamity.&nbsp; Little toes twitched: the bullfrog kept its
            cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually the sad and angry feet vanished down
            the voracious gullet.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, two other average-sized frogs sat huddled together in
            miserable terror amongst some rocks at the opposite edge of the
            pool, taking in Nature's gruesome matinee -- the one frog’s arm,
            this is totally true, draped over the back of its companion, one
            might imagine clutching fearfully.<br>
            <br>
            Did you know there have been seen in some regions pelicans
            swallowing live ducks?&nbsp; Shocking.&nbsp; The traveller was
            fascinated yet horrified.&nbsp; Endowed with strong feelings of
            empathy and a painfully vivid imagination, disturbing notions
            quickly accumulated as to the little frog’s terrible terrible death
            experience.&nbsp; A horror beyond human horrors.&nbsp; The sudden
            stupefaction of clamping darkness after being ripped so violently
            from an everyday ho-hum meditative moment at home under the peaceful
            setting sun.&nbsp; The traumatic, crashing shift in
            consciousness.&nbsp; Then the subsequent slow suffocation, the slick
            completeness of a peristaltic throaty grip and nothing to look
            forward to but churning acid stomach, or whatever the science of
            frog digestion. <br>
            <br>
            Nightmare images rushed forth in the traveller’s mind of a world in
            which animals and humans lived solely to consume those smaller
            versions of themselves in order to grow indefinitely large. &nbsp;
            The traveller's eyes drifted toward the distracted companion, still
            perusing postcards, and a distressing soliloquy spilled forth: 'I
            can't help imagining some humongous fellow with a huge frightening
            head and a mouth half a meter in diameter plowing down upon you
            unexpectedly and slowly sucking you into his esophagus.&nbsp; Your
            face trapped in a giant ribcage, this monstrous human appetite
            lifting your torso and flailing legs to the heavens for a
            gravity-assist toward some gruesome stench-filled melting hideous
            demise.&nbsp; Really, mere words cannot describe this hellish
            vision.&nbsp; And then — and then who’s to say there wouldn’t be
            another even bigger than —'<br>
            <br>
            The castle doors opened and the queen came delicately out across the
            moat to the roadway to find the two travellers lingering by the
            royal frog pool.<br>
            <br>
            'Isn’t it lovely?&nbsp; The king made it himself.&nbsp; There’s an
            enormous frog in there, even bigger than that fat one you see beside
            the lily.&nbsp; It’s just remarkable!&nbsp; But you know', lamented
            the queen, no longer boasting, 'there used to be dozens of frogs in
            the royal frog pool, so many, he collected them.&nbsp; Not as big as
            those.&nbsp; But somehow they’ve all gone.&nbsp; The king so enjoyed
            them when he was still with us.&nbsp; Before he…. well, I can’t
            imagine what’s become of them, of any of them.'<br>
            <br>
            The weary traveller straightened and sighed heavily.</p>

          <p>So a squirrel was driving down the road one evening, it was dark, i
            don’t know how dark i wasn’t there, i only heard about it.&nbsp; It
            had been raining earlier, that i remember, because i remember the
            day, i was polishing my antlers for the festival.&nbsp; Squirrel
            shifted in his seat.&nbsp; It’d been a long drive up from the
            valley.&nbsp; Nice night.&nbsp; Window was open, occasional tail
            fuzz in the face, it happens.&nbsp; At the side of the road way
            ahead, further around the bend, some of those pink forest babies,
            and some juveniles, the adults stooping and foraging for
            sandwiches.&nbsp; The babies round and hairless and ugly, not very
            mobile, the adults would have to pick them up and carry them from
            place to place.&nbsp; Little short squat young ones were waddling
            about, and as is inevitable with those creatures, an inexperienced
            little one wandered out into the road just as squirrel was coming up
            the hill and making the curve.&nbsp; WHAM!&nbsp; Crap! he yelled,
            not having swerved in time.&nbsp; Damn NUISANCE, stupid little
            humans, good lord, why can’t those messy things be eradicated.&nbsp;
            No matter, no harm done.&nbsp; Small they were and didn’t cause any
            damage to speeding vehicles which struck them willy nilly,
            especially in these rural parts.&nbsp; Highways too, though.&nbsp; I
            mean they were just everywhere.&nbsp; Seemed to breed
            indiscriminately any time of year.&nbsp; Squirrel shook his head,
            tsk.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Poor stupid fucker, but they should really
            stay underground where they’re out of our way.<br>
            <br>
            Pink baby smear on the side of the road.&nbsp; Gooey flesh and guts
            exploded out like a popped balloon.&nbsp; The others started at the
            impact, the male looked up and froze momentarily, sandwich dangling
            from its mouth, then it moved back slowly toward the woods, making a
            kind of hooting noise, their alarm sound.&nbsp; The female took a
            step toward the road then suddenly ran off, little ones bumbled
            about awkwardly after their parents.<br>
            <br>
            Soon after the road was quiet again.</p>

          <h3>from memories of a counter girl<br>
          </h3>
          <p><!--img src="test.jpg" alt="img here"--></p>
          <p>ancient guy comes in, deafened, oblivious, robotic… going through
            the motions of some long-learned ritual, off to the drycleaners,
            something to do.<br>
            <br>
            he probably lives at the assisted living center nearby.&nbsp; it’s
            just so depressing, his being so old and so barely there, in a
            perpetual daze, but driven to perform this routine as if it’s
            something he’s been obligated to continue, as though it’s an
            essential requirement of his remaining humanity.&nbsp; i imagine
            with terror myself at an impossible age, spaced out, mumbling
            incoherently, at the checkout counter with cans of cat food, though
            all the cats themselves are long gone, addicted to the act of going
            out for cat food at odd hours… and my apartment is stocked with
            hundreds of cans of a variety of brands and flavors because even the
            fading memory of my passed-on companions is finicky.</p>
